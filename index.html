    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As the IEEE Student Branch Chairman at SACET, I lead a dynamic team in organizing technical workshops, seminars, and innovation challenges, fostering a culture of learning and collaboration. In my role as EAF Coordinator, I bridge the gap between students and academic resources, ensuring effective participation in educational activities. My internship experience at Dixon Technologies India Limited strengthened my practical skills in embedded systems and PCB-based development. I’m an IoT enthusiast with hands-on experience in Arduino and Python, passionate about building smart, efficient solutions through technology.
